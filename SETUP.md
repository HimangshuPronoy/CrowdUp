# CrowdUp Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- A Supabase account (free tier works)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be provisioned

### 2. Set Up Database

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` from this project
3. Paste and run the SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor
4. This will create all necessary tables, indexes, and security policies
5. (Optional) If you want Google Sign-In, also run `migration-google-oauth.sql` to add OAuth support

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Get your Supabase credentials:
   - Go to Project Settings > API
   - Copy the Project URL
   - Copy the `anon` public key

3. Update `.env.local` with required values:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```

4. (Optional) Set up Google OAuth for "Sign in with Google":
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID (or use existing)
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
   - For production, also add: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
   - Add to `.env.local`:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
bun install
```

### 5. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## First Steps

1. Navigate to `/auth/signup` to create an account
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Create your first post
4. Start voting and engaging with content!

## Features

- ✅ Custom authentication (username/email + password)
- ✅ Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0)
- ✅ Create posts (Bug Reports, Feature Requests, Complaints)
- ✅ Upvote/downvote system
- ✅ User profiles
- ✅ Settings page
- ✅ Real-time data from Supabase

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials" error
- Make sure you've run the SQL schema in Supabase
- Check that your environment variables are correct

### Posts not showing
- Verify the database tables were created successfully
- Check browser console for any errors

### Authentication issues
- Clear localStorage and try again
- Note: RLS (Row Level Security) is disabled by default since we're using custom auth

## Important Notes

### Row Level Security (RLS)
This project uses **custom authentication** (not Supabase Auth), so Row Level Security is **disabled by default** in the SQL schema. This means:
- All authenticated operations are handled client-side
- Database tables are accessible with the anon key
- For production, consider migrating to Supabase Auth or implementing server-side API routes

### Security Considerations
- Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs before storage
- Auth state is stored in localStorage (client-side)
- For production apps, consider:
  - Server-side session management
  - HTTP-only cookies
  - Supabase Auth integration
  - API routes for sensitive operations
